cocos2d-iphone
--------------

cocos2d-iphone is a framework for building 2D games, demos, and other
graphical/interactive applications. It is based on the cocos2d [1] (python)
design:
  it uses the same API and design, but instead of using python it uses objective-c.

A cocos2d-iphone application consists of several scenes, and a workflow
connecting the different scenes. It provides you with a "director"
(a singleton) which handles that workflow between scenes. Each scene is
composed of an arbitrary number of layers; layers take care of drawing
to the screen (using the OpenGL ES APIs), handling events and in general
contain all of the game/application logic.

cocos2d-iphone simplifies the game development in these areas:

    * Defining a workflow for your game
    * Creating transitions between scenes
    * Managing sprites
    * Basic menus
    * Integrated Chipmunk 2d physics engine
    * Particle system
    * Text Rendering support
    * Touch/Accelerometer support
    * Integrated Pause/Resume
	* Language: objective-c



This library doesn't not work with the toolchain, but I
should be easy to port it to it.
