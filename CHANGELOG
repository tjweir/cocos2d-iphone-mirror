 . Demos: added filter to TcpAccelClient & Chipmunk_Accel demos (by Brian Hammond)
 . Director: propagates TouchEvents to all registered layers
 . Misc: Removed sound support. Not part of cocos2d
 . Misc: Moved OpenGLSupport inside the cocos2d directory. cocos2d.h includes OpenGLSupport headers

version 0.3.1 - 30-Jul-2008
 . All: methods that receives target/selector, are named:Target selector (unified API)
 . All: added "cocos2d.h". applications should only import this file.
 . Demos: added resume/pause to application

 . Particles: don't uses draw to update, uses scheduled step. (pause/resume works)
 . Scheduler: added interval timers
 . Transitions: they don't flickr (bug introduced in v0.3.0)
 . Types: created ccTime type (float or double) used to calculate delta time
 . Types: older types have the prefix "cc" (cocos)

 
version 0.3.0 - 27-Jul-2008
 . Actions: they are not cloned. If you want to reuse them, clone them manually using the method 'copy'
 . Actions: CallFunc, CallFuncN using performSelector instead of NSInvocator
 . Actions: added CallFuncN action. First argument is the target node
 . Core: Using own scheduler to schedule timers/etc.
 . Demos: Added OrbitCamera demo in SpritesDemo project
 . Director: can initialize the view with pixel format RGBA8 or RGB565 (default)
 . Director: if in landscape mode, tells the application to be in landscape mode too
 . Director: landscape mode is LEFT again, since "Touch fighter" (apple game) uses left landscape
